# Jackson's Learning README

## Welcome to my learning README!! I post all my notes here

## All the resrouces I've used:

### here are some learning work examples

- I found this great video series on Neural Networks by 3Blue1Brown, so I took a bunch of notes on it
- I applied the little that I know about neural networks and tried to make a neural network from scratch (it didn't go very well)
- I'm simplifying my project by using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), a library of optimized machine learning functions. I am figuring out how to use a dataloader to simplify the process of feeding my network training data

These are just some examples of what I've been working on. Explore this folder to see the extent of my learning!
