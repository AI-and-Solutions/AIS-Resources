# Complete PyTorch Tensor Tutorial
by Aladdin Persson

This README is documenting my learning of pytorch as I follow along with this 1-hour tutorial from [Aladdin Persson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9JiIFvlUwk&list=PLhhyoLH6IjfxeoooqP9rhU3HJIAVAJ3Vz&index=2), a youtuber who has a 50+ video series on PyTorch concepts.

## Abstract + Setup

I'm using the python venv I made [see this readme](../../../venv-setup/windows/readme.md), and set up a jupyter notebook to try and follow along with the examples. In the notebook, I can code as well as leave notes in markdown. I think this format will be more useful for my learning than just purely commenting about interesting things, or transferring all my notes into this readme. but I will leave general notes on the big concepts Mr. Persson lectures on

## initializing tensors

there are a lot of ways to initialize tensors in PyTorch. I count nearly 10 so far, and they differ in two ways: datatype and value. there are ways to initialize tensors with garbage memory, ones, or in a stepwise fashion. theres a way to call the identity matrix, and ways to even change the datatype of an existing tensor. its pretty fascinating.
