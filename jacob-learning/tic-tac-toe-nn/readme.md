# Tic Tac Toe NN

This is an attempt to make a neural network to solve tic tac toe (TTT). TTT is already a solved game, which means a NN is actually *less effective* than the algorithm for this task. However, because its solved I know there's a dataset of the expected move for every board. Additionally, the number of boards should be small, so training is not an issue.

I'll use the PyTorch framework, and maybe try implementing this from scratch after if I find it easy. Will be documenting my progress in here.
